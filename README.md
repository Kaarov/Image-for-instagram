# Image for Instagram

# What we should to do?
> As you can see, we have written code that takes images and modifies it.
> We have to write a code that should change its size to (1080, 1080) and the background color to B/W. And at the end adds to all images a watermark (can be image or text) at right bottom corner.

# Explanations

> In Photo 1 you can see our example.
We took 10 images of cars, you can take more. In the main.py file has written our main code that will do all the work.

> In Photo 2 you see the code.
First we imported models from Pillow(Image, ImageDraw, ImageFont) and the OS itself.

> Then we have lists with possible endings and size.

> Creating a new folder ( IMG )

> We check all files to see if the end of the files matches with ours. If it matches, then change its size and background color to B/W.

> At the end, we add a watermark to the bottom right corner.

> As a result, we got what we wanted. All images with a size (1080,1080), with a black and white image and a watermark (10R)
